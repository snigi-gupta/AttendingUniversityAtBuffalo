## How to select courses in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd semesters?
- 1st Sem: 1 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard -*OR*- 1 Easy 3 Medium
- 2nd Sem: 3 Medium 1 Hard -*OR*- 1 Easy 1 Medium 2 Hard -*OR*- 1/3 Easy 3/2 Medium (Can Take 5 subjects)
- 3rd Sem: 2 Easy -*OR*- 1 Medium 1 Easy

## How to complete MS Requirements?
- Choose your specialization
- Choose 4 course 1 from each Breadth (AI/ML, Software, Hardware, Algorithms)
- Choose 2 courses from your specialized field. 1 MUST be a 600-level course. The other can be a 500 or 600 level course. These are depth requirements.
- Choose 1 additional course from the same/any other Breadth. It can be 500/600 level.
- Choose 1-3 credits of Seminar which is a 700 level course. You can choose up to 6 credits of Seminar also. You can choose up to 6 credits of courses from any other department also if you have permission from the Grad-coordinator and the Grad-Director.
- Do one MS Project (is dependent on the course you select)
- __Always refer to the graduate handbook of your year.__ Link to Handbook Directory: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/information-for-faculty-and-staff/administration/handbooks.html
- __Minimum GPA Criteria:__ This is a VERY important criterion. You minimum GPA should be 3.0 or above across the average sum of the 4 focus area.</br>
So for example, if my breadth subjects are IML(Introduction to Machine Learning), AOA(Analysis of Algorithms), DS(Distributed Systems), and IR(Information Retrieval), then the average of only these four subjects should be 3.0 or above. It is possible at times that your overall GPA is 3.0 (or above) but your breadth average GPA is below 3.0. In that case, you will have to extend your graduation to another semester.
- These requirements are to be completed during your entire graduation time (ideally within 3 semesters)

## Grading system of UB
- Absolute grading: Cut-off is decided by the professor and accordingly grades are assigned.
- Relative grading: Cut-off is decided based on the final class performance and accordingly grades are assigned. 
For types of grades check out this link: https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/explanation.html

## How to know the difficulty of the course?
- The best way is to audit the class and attend the first lecture. On the first day, the presentation has all logistics mentioned. If you cannot audit, ask a friend who has to share the ppt with you that has the logistics.
- When in doubt email the professor. Find all faculty email ids here: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory.html
- Refer for timings, schedule, number of lectures, and hours of lectures from the official website to understand how many hours you will be spending in lectures.
For the Spring 2021 batch, the link is: http://www.buffalo.edu/class-schedule?switch=showcourses&semester=spring&division=2&dept=CSE
- 1 credit = 2 hours of study/week. So for a course of 4 credits, you will be spending 8-10 hours of study time per week. So for 4 courses, 12 credits in total, it will amount to 40hrs/week of study time (this is approximate).
- Difficulty level of a course depends on 3 factors:
  - Professor's teaching style
  - Course structure
  - Your hard work
- Course structure can one or more of these components
  - Assignments (usually takes a week to complete. Most times has 10-20% weightage)
  - Project Assignments (usually takes 2 weeks to complete. Most times has 20-30% weightage)
  - Project (usually is a semester-long, or can also be month-long projects. Most time has <50% weightage)
  - Quiz (usually is weekly or every time you attend the class. Most times has 5-10% weightage)
  - Mid Term Exam (There can be up to 2 mid-terms. Usually has 20-40% weightage)
  - Final Term Exam (Usually has 30-40% weightage. In some courses can also be more).
  - Class participation (Usually has 5% weightage and is kept to keep you consistent in attending classes) </br>
___Do note that course can have a combination of these components. Depends on the professor.___
- To understand reviews of the course you can check out this website where students give honest reviews about professors and courses: https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=960

## What is a Seminar, Independent Study, Supervised Research?
- Seminar: Used to explore a topic and have small hands-on. Mostly involves reading research papers and presenting. Can also have projects. Seminars with a project are considered a hard course.
- Independent Study: You can opt for this only if the professor agrees. This course needs to be forced registers. You may or may not be paid for it. Your grades depend on the quality of the work you present. This is something like, each week you show progress in the work assigned to you and you should be a good student in the eyes of the professor.
- Supervised Research: Not much different than Independent Study. The professor helps here officially. Although in the independent study also you get some guidance.

611 by Alan Hunt </br>
Algorithms for Modern Computing Systems by Russ Miller</br>

## Who should take 611?
- Anyone who wants to explicitly complete their MS Project requirement. It might be that the course you opted for does not have a MS project component. In that case you must take 611.
- This course should also be opted by any new grad who wants to show some industy-like experience and does not have any prior experience to showcase on their resume. This course is very ideal for those who joined UB right after their undergrad.

### You can choose 5 courses but make sure to balance them well. UB will not charge you over 12 credits, which means you do not pay for the fifth course.

## TA/RA/GA/Technical Jobs
- TA or Teaching Assistantship is not so readily given to masters students. This is very much dependent on the professor. Usually, Ph.D. students are TAs at UB.
- RA or Research Assistantship, GA or Graduate Assistantship might be possible for MS students. Check out Handshake for university related jobs. For RA stay in touch with your professor and stay in their 'good books'.
- For any other technical job, checkout handshake.

## Handshake, Piazza and MyHUB
- Handshake is a monster.com equivalent job portal especially designed to cater to the needs of university students. You can find part-time as well as on-campus jobs here. Make sure to keep your profile updated here. You can also apply to many internships and jobs via Handshake. There is an app version too.
- Piazza is a forum web application for students. Each course you enroll yourself in will be visible at Piazza. There is also an app version of this. Professors communicate with the class using piazza. Every assignment/project is officially released here. You can also ask your doubts and discuss them with your fellow classmates.
- MyHUB is a UB space where you get to update your important personal information, check your official grades, enroll in new courses, etc. Always make sure you have zero(0) holds on MyHUB before your course enrollment day.
- Some more important yet handy apps: Blackboard and UB Mobile

## Exams at UB
- Almost every exam I took was MCQ except for Algorithms. Exams duration can vary based on the course.
- Some exams can be open book. Do not mistake open book exams to be easy. Study seriously.
- Some exams also allow you to make a 1-2 page cheatsheet. It depends on you how well you make your notes/cheatsheet.

## Mistake students often do
- Not study regularly. US Education system is designed for consistent workers rather than last-minute workers. Make sure you give 2hrs a day to each subject.
- Plagiarise or cheat. UB is very strict when it comes to cheating. CSE Department especially has very strict rules. It is better to get a zero(0) than >F< which will haunt you all your life. Your visa status can be revoked from the USA. CSE AI rules listed here: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/information-for-students/policies/academic-integrity.html
- Class attendance: I have observed from my personal experience that attending classes is only useful if you have self-studied the night before what is going to be taught in class. So make sure to brush up on the presentation slide or class notes before the lecture day. This will help you understand what the professor is teaching and also ask doubts in the class. Attending class without self-study is useless and in that case, skip the class and first self-study.
- Not attending TA Sessions. When in doubt, instead of asking your friend to teach you the topic, go to the TA session to get your doubt cleared. It 100% better. Your understanding will be proper and complete.
- Not participating in extracurricular activities. All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. Interacting and networking will keep you aware of many things that happen around UB. So step up your game and try to interact with many people and with various types of people. Join clubs and do group activities. 
- Stay in touch with your seniors. They can be your potential mentors and guide you well.
- Not work on their resume. Your resume is the most important step in getting you the job.
- Compare yourself to others. This is something students do inherently. Your journey is unique. Not everyone has the same experience as you have. So make sure to remind yourself to never compare yourself with anyone else's success or failure.

## Tips
- Network from the very first day
- Utilize your summer even if you do not have an internship. Join boot-camp, or volunteer with a professor, do an unpaid internship or work on your side project.
- Be professional. 
  - Reply to the recruiter with a thank you note whenever you get a reject (if not an automated email). 
  - Introduce yourself and ask for the person's time when reaching out to a stranger. 
  - Send a personalized LinkedIn note when you are sending a connection request.
- Never give up

### If you still have questions, you can start a new discussion in the discussion tab of the Github page. That way your question can be valuable and helpful to someone else too. I will answer it whenever possible.

### All the very best for your Masters journey! You will rock it!
